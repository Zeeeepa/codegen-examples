# Advanced Codegen Agent Architecture

## Overview

The Advanced Codegen Agent is a sophisticated, context-aware code generation system that leverages comprehensive codebase analysis, intelligent retry logic, and quality assessment to produce high-quality code that integrates seamlessly with existing projects.

## Architecture Components

- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies architectural patterns, naming conventions, and code styles
- **Quality Analysis**: Assesses code quality, test coverage, and maintainability

#### Context Types:
- **CodebaseContext**: File structure, languages, dependencies, patterns
- **TaskContext**: Current task requirements, constraints, and priorities
- **TeamContext**: Coding standards, preferred patterns, testing requirements

### 2. Advanced Codegen Client (`codegen_client.py`)

The core client that orchestrates code generation with context awareness and retry logic.

#### Key Features:

- **Multi-mode Generation**: Supports different generation modes (feature, bug fix, refactoring)

#### Generation Modes:
- `FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT`: New feature implementation

### 3. Retry Logic (`retry_logic.py`)

Sophisticated retry mechanism with multiple strategies and circuit breaking.

#### Key Features:
- **Multiple Retry Strategies**: Exponential backoff, linear backoff, fixed delay, adaptive
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Reason-Specific Configuration**: Different retry behavior for different failure types
- **Jitter Support**: Adds randomness to prevent thundering herd
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Tracks retry patterns and success rates

#### Retry Reasons:
- `QUALITY_THRESHOLD`: Generated code below quality threshold
- `API_ERROR`: Codegen API errors
- `RATE_LIMIT`: API rate limiting
- `NETWORK_ERROR`: Network connectivity issues
- `TIMEOUT`: Request timeouts
- `VALIDATION_FAILED`: Custom validation failures

### 4. Quality Assessor (`quality_assessor.py`)

Comprehensive code quality assessment engine.

#### Quality Dimensions:
- **Readability**: Code clarity, naming conventions, formatting
- **Maintainability**: Complexity, modularity, documentation
- **Correctness**: Syntax, logic, error handling
- **Performance**: Algorithm efficiency, resource usage
- **Security**: Vulnerability detection, secure coding practices
- **Documentation**: Comment coverage, API documentation
- **Testing**: Test presence and quality

#### Assessment Features:
- **Language-Specific Analysis**: Tailored assessment for different programming languages
- **Security Pattern Detection**: Identifies common security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Anti-Pattern Detection**: Finds inefficient code patterns
- **Complexity Metrics**: Calculates various complexity measures
- **Style Analysis**: Evaluates code formatting and conventions

### 5. Feedback Processor (`feedback_processor.py`)

Processes validation feedback and integrates it back into the generation process.

#### Feedback Types:
- `QUALITY_FEEDBACK`: Quality assessment results
- `ERROR_FEEDBACK`: Error messages and stack traces
- `VALIDATION_FEEDBACK`: External validation results
- `PERFORMANCE_FEEDBACK`: Performance test results
- `SECURITY_FEEDBACK`: Security scan results
- `USER_FEEDBACK`: Human reviewer feedback

#### Processing Features:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common feedback patterns
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Generates actionable improvement recommendations
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Enhances prompts with feedback for retry attempts
- **Learning Integration**: Learns from feedback to improve future generations

### 6. Prompt Templates (`prompt_templates/`)

Specialized prompt templates for different generation scenarios.

#### Template Categories:
- **Feature Generation**: Templates for new feature development
- **Bug Fixing**: Templates for systematic bug resolution
- **Refactoring**: Templates for code improvement and optimization

#### Template Features:
- **Context Integration**: Incorporates codebase and team context
- **Mode-Specific Instructions**: Tailored guidance for different scenarios
- **Quality Standards**: Embedded quality requirements and best practices
- **Pattern Learning**: Incorporates learned patterns from previous successes
